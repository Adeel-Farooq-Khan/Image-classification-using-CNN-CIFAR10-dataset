# Image-classification-using-CNN-CIFAR10-dataset-
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary goal is to classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy. CNNs, known for their exceptional performance in image-related tasks, are employed to achieve this objective.

## Key Features
Model Architecture: The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers to perform the classification task.
Data Preprocessing: The images are normalized and resized to ensure compatibility with the model.
Training: The model is trained using a labeled dataset, with optimization techniques applied to improve performance.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on a test dataset, and predictions are made to verify its effectiveness.
## Libraries Used
TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.

Keras: To simplify model creation and training processes.

NumPy: For handling data arrays and performing numerical computations.

## Results
The CNN model achieved accuracy: 0.7864 in classifying images into their respective categories, demonstrating its effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
